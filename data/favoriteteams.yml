        comment: I wasn't always a Ranger fan.  I had family in Houston and saw my
          first MLB game at the Astrodome.  But in High School and more in College
          my fandom went to the true Texas team.  And haven't looked back.  Also
          got my Mom enjoying the games!

  - sport: basketball
    info:
      - league: National Basketball Association
        favorite: Dallas Mavericks
        link: https://www.mavs.com/
        comment: Another team I didn't always support.  I didn't have a true team
          for a long time, and since the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets were
          both better teams than the Mavericks throughout the 90's, I waffled
          between the three.  Around 2002, I finally committed to the Mavericks...
          don't know why (they still weren't all that great at that time), but have
          enjoyed watching them ever since.

  - sport: hockey
    info:
      - league: National Hockey League
        favorite: Dallas Stars
        link: https://www.nhl.com/stars/
        comment: I was a Boston Bruins fan for no reason for a long time.  Texas
          didn't have a real hockey team and when the North Stars moved south, I
          didn't join in.  I didn't even move over when they won the Stanley Cup!
          I've only been a Stars fan for around 5 years (at the time of this
          writing), and can't say I miss the Bruins.  Even when they weren't doing
          well, watching the young team find there identity and deal with some of
          the _veteran_ leadership they supposedly brought in was entertaining.

  - sport: soccer
    info:
      - league: Major League Soccer
        favorite: FC Dallas
        link: https://www.fcdallas.com/
        comment: I held no soccer allegiance before moving to Dallas and as such
          never really followed the _Hoops_.  But around 2010-2011-ish, I started
          following because of Brek Shea was doing some crazy awesome stuff prior
          to his English and Klinsmann meltdown.  Since then I've kept up with
          their progress.

        comment: Because I can unite in a group of people that maintain an extreme
          dislike for Tom Hicks.  I figure that commonality would allow me to
          overlook any cultural differences if I were to attend a match...ever.

  - sport: lacrosse
    info:
      - league: Major League Lacrosse
        favorite: Dallas Rattlers
        link: http://dallasrattlers.com/
        comment: So didn't pay much attention to Lacrosse until my son started
          playing.  Then I was guessing we could be a Denver Outlaws fan based on
          relative proximity versus other teams...and Outlaws...you know, I'm from
          Texas. But Rochester moved to Dallas, so now I'm a Rattlers fan.  Being
          they were 3rd place prior to moving, it's even a plus that it's not a
          basement team.
