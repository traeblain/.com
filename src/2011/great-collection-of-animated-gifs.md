Slug: great-collection-of-animated-gifs

This is a great collection of animated gifs that can go with a number of situations. There's a great clip Michael Jackson eating popcorn, a Dr. Stranglove chew gif, an interesting Burton Guster eating popcorn, Stephen Colbert eating popcorn, some creepy guy eating popcorn, probably someone else eating popcorn...Oh! and Riker's Beard.
