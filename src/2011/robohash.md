RoboHash is an image generator based on a hash. So essencially you can enter any text and get a special robot that only applies to that text, but it is hashed so it won't change based on different text. I typed in "Mary had a little lamb" and "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood" and some more. Check out your name, username, etc. Crazy combinations. You can use the image anywhere by just linking to http://robohash.org/[your words].png and if you'd rather have a monster add ?set=set2 or if you just want a robotic head add ?set=set3 you can even set the size. Neat little tool.
