Go One-on-One with the four time Defensive Player of the Year, Ben Wallace. This thing inflates to 7 feet tall to help any young ball player learn to shoot around a stationary target. I suppose it works, but it's just funny to have an inflatable dude on your driveway. Woot had them for $9.99 not too long ago, and if I was able to get it before it ended I would have. You could creep a bunch of people with this guy.
