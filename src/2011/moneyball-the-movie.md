I have been excited about the [Moneyball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) movie for a while. And to finally see the preview pumps me up. Seeing Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright was great to see that they were taking the movie seriously. But then I saw Jonah Hill playing the role of DePodesta role (I thought Demetri Martin was playing the role), and it's about enough to make me jump ship. Apparently DePodesta didn't like the choice either, [asking them to not use his name](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/08/if_its_cool_with_everyone_paul.html). Of course, DePodesta a central figure in Beane's sabermetric scouting and Jonah Hill cannot be a more different person. I won't completely pass judgement. I'll wait and see, but my excitement has definitely wained.
