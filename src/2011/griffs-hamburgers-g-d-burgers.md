[![Griffs 1](http://blog.traeblain.com/wp-content/uploads/IMAG0153-e1316885941955-500x382.jpg)](http://blog.traeblain.com/wp-content/uploads/IMAG0153.jpg)[Griff's Hamburgers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griff's_Hamburgers) has been around since the 1960's and made some waves recently when an NFL player claimed that Griff's was much better than In-N-Out and all the hype about In-N-Out's jump to Texas was unnecessary. With all that history, I decided to give it a try. 

Griff's is much less than it used to be with fewer locations than it once had. Regardless, I jumped on the one in Garland. Most common is the Double Giant which is a double meat, double cheese, lettuce, onions, and pickles with mustard. No tomatoes on this one.

I'm pretty sure the meat was frozen and nothing else was truly fresh. But it doesn't deny the fact that Griff's has figured out a way to make the best of their situation. The burger was[ actually good, not great, but good](http://blog.traeblain.com/20110704/the-great-dallas-burger-search/). And my bill, along with Ben's grilled cheese, was $7...seriously $7.

Griff's is much, much, much better than McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, and most others. I'd say it is slightly better than Whataburger. And I like me some Whataburger. I can't deny that there are still better places, but at such a low price I can definitely see myself returning. 

Have you been to Griff's? What did you think?
