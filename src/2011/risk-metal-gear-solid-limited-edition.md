Get your own Limited Edition copy of RISK, but styled around Metal Gear Solid. Geeks unite. I personally could never stomach a complete game of RISK, the only games I completely played was when I could go play Ping-Pong or something when it wasn't my turn and people weren't attacking my Australia (Australia is the key...own Australia, own the world...). This is a pretty nice set though and for any RISK fan would be fun to have. Pre-Order Soon.
