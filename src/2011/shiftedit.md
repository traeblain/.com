Working on my personal webserver had always been a chore to make simple edits anywhere and everywhere. I normally used FTP (something like WinSCP or CyberDuck) to pull the file down and automatically make uploads. But it was inconsistent. Say I was somewhere w/o my personal computer, I had to cludge my way through editing and uploading. ShiftEdit has allowed me to have a standardized IDE so that all those edits and uploading can be the same no matter where I'm at, I just need a web browser. It's been actually allowed me to play and experiment with new ideas (etc.) on my web server that I wouldn't have otherwise. It's a great tool and I recommend you use it for yours. Supports FTP, SFTP, and Dropbox acocunts.
