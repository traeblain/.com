So, I've come to the realization that I've dreaded for a while...

I'm not an avid reader, I enjoy a great fiction, I try to read more because I feel it truly does something to your brain that counters what Television does. It's just a smart thing to do. For the past two years I've used the great site [Readernaut](http://readernaut.com/traeblain/) to catalog and record my books. Loading reviews, comments, habits, logging has been pushed into Readernaut. Readernaut looks amazing (compared to other sites...everytime I look at [LibraryThing](http://www.librarything.com/) feel like I've jumped into 1999) and the way it worked differently from other sites fit exactly in my expectation of what a Book site should. Space for reviews, space where you can comment on specific pages/paragraphs, and a concise view of what your friends are reading. All this done in a beautiful space that didn't drown you in Suggested Friends, Book Clubs, Recommended Reading Lists, etc. 

BUT, (yup--there it is) I just couldn't stick with the site any longer and it makes me sad. [Nathan Borror](http://nathanborror.com/) works for [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) and [Readernaut](http://readernaut.com/) is his side project and he's the only designer/developer for the site. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but since this is only a side project the evolution of the site has been abysmally slow. Listen, I don't want to slight Mr. Borror for his work, because it's a great site. Though I found it constantly lacking on a couple of items: 

#### Incomplete API 

Now all you non-nerds are asking what the heck is this. An API--in basic terms --allows people to get information in and out of the site in a safe and proper manner. What does this mean? Basically it would allow other developers to do some awesome things with the site. Think what [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/) is to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)/Facebook. This would have led to correcting some of the other issues. 

#### No Mobile Capabilities 

I began really hating that Readernaut doesn't work well on mobile devices. I now do most of my reading through my [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp?cm_mmc=Redirect-_-nook.com-_-Storefront-_-nook) (my 1st edition device and [on my phone](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook-for-android/379002287/?cds2Pid=38497)) and updating my reading status on both the web browser on my Nook and browsing on my phone was horribly laborious. I need something that I can jump in, update reading status, add books, and more on my mobile devices and Readernaut hasn't met that need. 

#### Small-to-No Community 

Now that I'm reading more, I love getting recommendations from people for books that I can read that match my favorite style. The problem is that it is hard to find those recommendations that aren't this eras _Harry Potter_. I know _Vampires_ are hot right now, but I could care less about those books. And the small community of Readernaut didn't help. I really never got acceptable recommendations from others. 

## So I Moved to GoodReads 

There were three options to go to. [Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com/), [GetGlue](http://www.getglue.com/), and [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/). Shelfari was the site I used to use before moving to Readernaut, and honestly it isn't bad but it hasn't done anything since I left and what they have done is solely for the Kindle. GetGlue is a nice site but is for more than just book reading. Since it does everything, it doesn't do a single thing (books) very well. So I'm now using GoodReads. 

That's the reasons I moved. A good API, mobile site, and a huge community. I've already hit up the mobile site on the Nook and it works well so I can update my reading as I read it.
