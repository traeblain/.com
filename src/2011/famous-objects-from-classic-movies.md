Famous Objects from Classic Movies, is a game where you are only given the outline (ish) of an object from a 'famous' movie and you have to type it out. You can only miss 3 letters, but yes it gets really hard later on. Was just under 90%, but most of those came at the very end with movies like Akira, Battleship Potemkin, etc.
