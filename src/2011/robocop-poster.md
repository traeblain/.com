[![Robocop](http://blog.traeblain.com/wp-content/uploads/robocop_thumb.jpg)](http://www.mondoarchive.com/poster/robocop/)[Olly Moss](http://www.mondotees.com/) is one of the greatest movie poster re-designer I've seen. I've posted before about the beautiful Star Wars posters ([ANH](http://www.mondoarchive.com/poster/star-wars-copy-copy/), [ESB](http://www.mondoarchive.com/poster/empire-strikes-back-copy/), [RotJ](http://www.mondoarchive.com/poster/return-of-the-jedi/)), but this RoboCop poster is almost just as good as those. This guy is amazing, please support his work.
