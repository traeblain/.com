I've been using this for a while, since it was called RadioTime. I work in
what's practically a Faraday cage, so getting actual radio is very difficult.
This is great to throw on when I want to drown out the chitter-chatter around
me. They also have great apps for iPhone, Android, WebOS, Blackberry, and
more. Was able to listen to local radio when out of town, can't beat that.
