This trip is to the famous [Five Guys Burgers and Fries](http://www.fiveguys.com/index.aspx). Five Guys started in Arlington, Va. where along with 5 additional locations in the Washington D.C. metro area have created a cult following that would rival that of In-N-Out Burger. This rivalry is even more hard hitting than the football styles, East coast v. West coast...it's never been the same. Lately Five Guys has been branching out and there are a number of locations in the North Texas area.

So I ordered the standard Five Guys Cheeseburger (double meat). [The rules](http://blog.traeblain.com/20110704/the-great-dallas-burger-search/) are difficult here, because you order your burger with whatever toppings you want, and the list is pretty nice. I tried to keep it as generic as to be capable of getting a good comparison. So, lettuce, onions, pickles, and mustard was the standard fair. I really wanted to add jalapenos or go with some A-1, but I'm thinking of nixing that rule as it has a possibility of making a burger better than it really is.

The meat was excellent. Well cooked to be juicy but not greasy. The double meat is not bad, it's not a overtly meaty burger. The cheese was perfectly melted and overall was a well prepared burger.

The toppings tasted very fresh. The lettuce was not shredded, which is an amazing plus. When you bit into the burger, you had the softness of the meat and bun coupled with a nice crunch from the lettuce. The onions were chopped so it was hard to tell of the onion were actually fresh.  Pickles weren't too soggy, so I would suspect they haven't been swimming in the juices too long. The bun was a bit smashed and wasn't toasted. Toasting could have helped a bit.

Five Guys fries are pretty awesome. I know they are fresh, because the they label the farm in which today's fries came from.  They are well fried, there were only a few soggy ones and they were not overly salty. They also have 'cajun' fries, but I haven't tried them.

I really like these burgers. Since there is essentially no atmosphere (although you get complimentary peanuts while you wait), I think the price is a bit high @ $5.90.  It is a very good burger though, and easily recommendable. Expect to eat at a place that feels like a fast-food restaurant.

Probably the best grilled cheese Little B's eaten yet. Five guys takes a burger bun, inverts the buns so the outsides of the buns are touching the cheese and grill it up that way.  [He loved it!](http://blog.traeblain.com/wp-content/uploads/IMAG0133.jpg)
