Randy Glass does a number of Hedcuts for the Wall Street Journal. These are of celebrities and notable many of them are of characters they have played in films. These hedcuts are done with the classic 'stipple' technique created by using pen dots to create the image. These are really nice. I laughed at their organization though, I see Harry Potter getting older and older then--BAM!!-- old Harry Potter looks very much like Denis Quaid! hehe.
