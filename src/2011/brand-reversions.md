Graham Smith takes some popular logos and used that company's competitor's designs to recreate the company logo. Confused? Basically there's logos that look like it's competitors. Wal-Mart logo done in the style of Best Buy's logo, Google's logo done in the style of Yahoo!'s logo. I think the best reversion is the UPS/FedEx logo as well as most of the car manufacturer's logos.
