There are some very classic Christmas music out there.  I'm a fan of music, so that makes me an expert on good Christmas music.  Here's a list of my favorites, these are the songs that I actually wouldn't mind listening to year round.

## 5. I Saw Three Ships - Sting

Don't remember the first time I heard this song, but I do know it was on a cassette.  I really dug the tune, and Sting plays it at a very nice cadence.

## 4. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel - Punch Brothers

I dig a great folk Christmas song.  This one is one of the best.  Punch Brothers is probably one of the most talented ensemble of folk musicians.  They do this song a great justice, with spectacular fiddle play.

## 3. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen / We Three Kings - Barenaked Ladies (feat. Sarah McLachlan)

_God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen_ is probably my favorite classic Christmas song.  I loved the way the music goes from a bit punchy in the verses, then the smooth '_Star of wonder/Star of night_'.  This version in particular puts Barenaked Ladies very unique style on the song, and McLachlan's overtones balance very nicely.

## 2. A Christmas Song - Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds

One of my all time favorite musicians and a very well written and played song.  Slowly played with a full sound although only with two guitars and a Dave's vocals.

## 1. Christmas / Sarajevo (Carol of the Bells) - Trans Siberian Orchestra

_Carol of the Bells_ is a great song in and of itself, but TSO does something with this song and elevates it even higher.  I love this song so much, in college I actually arranged a 3 part guitar version of the Carol that merged into _God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen_.  Wanted to perform it with a couple guys, but could never get together long enough to hash it out.
