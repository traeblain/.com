This could be the greatest [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) music video I've seen in a long time. [OK Go](http://www.youtube.com/user/okgo?ob=4) has some great videos that are very creative. But creative "YouTube Music Videos" are almost expected these days. This video is so simple, it's great. Let's just ignore the fact that the voice meld greatly and [the song](http://www.amazon.com/Somebody-That-I-Used-Know/dp/B006ZDU8EE/) was one of the best songs of 2011. Enjoy!
