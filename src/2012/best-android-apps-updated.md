I haven't updated my favorite [Android Applications](http://blog.traeblain.com/20110626/the-best-android-apps/) list in a while, and a number of applications have suplanted those in the list. So I'm here to correct for that.

## Social

![](/static/images/2012/googleplus_hover.svg)[Google+](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus): Google Plus is actually a good app. It is simple and easy to use. It also allows you to auto upload your pictures to Google Photos (which will be Picasa down the road). Free 

## Entertainment

![](/static/images/2012/camerazoom.png)[Camera Zoom FX](https://market.android.com/details?id=slide.cameraZoom): Replacing [Vignette](https://market.android.com/details?id=uk.co.neilandtheresa.NewVignette) as the best true camera-app replacement is Camera Zoom FX. Camera Zoom does standard capture plus a Timered, Action, and Time Lapse. It does filters and borders, amoung others. You can also download special items, like take your picture with the Queen. $2.99

![](/static/images/2012/pixlromatic.png)[Pixlr-O-Matic](https://market.android.com/details?id=pixlr.OMatic): Replacing [Retro Camera](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.urbian.android.tools.vintagecam) is Pixlr-O-Matic. These photos are great with one of the prettiest interfaces out there. It's simple to use and has a ton of options. I wish they'd integrate with a sharing service natively, but the standard Android sharing works nicely. Free

![](/static/images/2012/googlemusic.png)[Google Music](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.music): I really love the [DoubleTwist](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer) interface, but using Google Music has been much easier. I really liked the syncing with my library, but now my library syncs with Google online and then to my phone instantly. Great experience and the latest update is nice. Free

## Productivity

![](/static/images/2012/swiftkeyx.png)[Swiftkey X](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey): Sadly, I have replaced [Swype](http://swypeinc.com/myswype.html) with a better keyboard. I was having more and more trouble with Swype's dictionary. It would add words on a whim. Just because I typed something once, doesn't mean I may ever type it again (web addresses, capture codes, etc.). With Swiftkey it's great. And honestly, I should really get used to touch typing as Swype may not be on every phone I use. $3.99

![](/static/images/2012/readitlaterpro.jpg)[Read It Later](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.free) and [Read It Later Pro](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro): [Instafetch](https://market.android.com/details?id=pl.immortal.instafetch) worked well to sync my reading items from Instapaper, but Read It Later is a much better app. Now they have a free version and it works well. Free/$2.99

![](/static/images/2012/esfileexplorer.png)[ES File Explorer](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop): ES is free, add free, and works with rooted devices. It's one of the best file explorers out there. I cannot deny the greatness that this is when I need a file manager. Free.

That's it for now. I will update my [Best Android Apps](http://blog.traeblain.com/20110626/the-best-android-apps/) page to reflect these changes soon, so check it out to get the best apps you need.
