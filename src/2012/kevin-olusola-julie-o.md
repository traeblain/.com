This isn't new and has traveled a bit, but still worth sharing. [Kevin Olusola][1] is not only a cellist, but a saxophonist. He's classically trained and a reality show winner.

Olusola might (now) be better known for winning [NBC's The Sing Off][2], but this is where I think Olusola really excels. Awesome!
