Every year, I show everyone my bracket. So I decided to give you a nice little show here. I have invest a massive amount of time watching college basketball and evaluating each tourney team. Seriously, I probably have at least 37 minutes invested here. I'm pretty much an expert.

#### Second Round

(Yes it's the second round, 60 teams recieved a first round bye and 4 teams had to compete for the the next round.)

I'll update as the Tournament progresses...stay tuned.

#### Sweet 16

Mother of God...this is horrible. This will probably be my last update...because it's horrible. Horrible.
