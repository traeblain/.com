The final chapter to the books from I read in 2013.  It is definitely sad that all this fun is coming to an end, but it had to at some point right?  If you need to catch up (no worries, only 2 of the reviews are all that long) check out my [initial post][quick], my [first follow-up][II], [The Devil in the White City][III] review, my [second follow-up group][IV], and my [Steelheart][V] review.  Now on to the final list.

## Argo by Antonio Mendez {: #argo }

![Argo]({filename}../static/images/2014/argo.jpg "Argo"){: .alignright }
_[Argo][]: How the CIA & Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History_ is just that.  If you haven't seen the Ben Affleck movie, you should...it's good watching.  The book isn't anything spectacular, but is worth the read.  It is just a smattering of details of how the CIA was able to start what appeared to be a reputable production company, fool the Iranians into thinking they wanted to film a movie there, and ultimately get 6 Americans out to safety.  It is a really interesting story.  Two things stood out to me, first the fact that the CIA learned from Hollywood greats how to make a person look like someone else.  And second, how awesome the Canadians were through the whole ordeal.  The movie didn't highlight this, but without Canada, the rescue would not have happened.  A good read and worth the time.

**3 Stars**

## The Second Ship by Richard Phillips {: #secondship }

![The Second Ship]({filename}../static/images/2014/secondship.jpg "The Second Ship"){: .alignleft }
[The Second Ship][secondship] is the first novel in the _Rho Agenda Trilogy_, and possibly the strongest.  The story is about 3 high school students that find an alien ship near Los Alamos, NM and by interacting with the ship, it begins to "change" them.  And then these high school students do what you'd expect high school students with new abilities do...get into trouble.  This sound childish, but it is definitely not.  There are dark characters, questionable good guys, and tons of fun.  It was really a fun read.  You can relate to and one of three kids, and other characters are very intriguing.  Just know that this is the first of a series and more was planned from the start.  You'll want to carve out time for all three.

**4 Stars**
