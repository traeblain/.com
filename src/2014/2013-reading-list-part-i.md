Status: draft

So I succeeded in reading more books in 2013.  My [grand total is 47][goodreads]
according to GoodReads.  That's great, especially since I only read like 7 books
the previous year.  So now how do I rate and discuss 47 books.  I'll start with
the few I already spoke about in [this post][quickreview] and embelish a bit,
then continue on to the rest of the books in follow-up posts.  Hope you enjoy.
