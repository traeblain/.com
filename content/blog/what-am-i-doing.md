title: What am I doing?
description: Another year of minimal posting. The real challenge is finding a workflow that makes creating content here feel effortless instead of tedious. Considering everything from custom CMS solutions to using Jupyter Notebooks as source files for more interactive, data-driven posts.

Another year of radio silence on the site. No apologies--I've been genuinely busy with other things, and honestly, that's perfectly fine. When I do eventually come back to writing here with any regularity, it'll be because I actually have something worth saying, not just to fill space with throwaway content (unlike today...hehe).

This year brought a lot more reading and some hands-on experiments with a new 3D printer that's been keeping me occupied. I've also been tinkering away at getting a parametric viewer set up for some of my simpler models, though I still need to track down where I stashed the latest code for that project.

Usually around this time of year I get the itch to completely redesign the site's style, but this current version actually works pretty well. Sure, the artist images from my latest listens are mysteriously broken and I need to figure out what's going on there, but the overall layout and structure feel right. The real challenge I'm facing? Finding a genuinely smooth workflow for getting content posted and properly previewed without burning through hours of setup time. I'm starting to think I might have to build my own lightweight CMS to make the whole process actually work the way I want it to.

Some ideas that have been rattling around in my head:
- I need to refactor the "Links" post type so it pulls directly from my [Linkwarden][] collection or maybe from a simple data file instead
- The "Quote" type only has a single post anyway—if that whole category vanishes, no real loss there
- I've got this plan brewing for handling status updates through [Discord][] as a makeshift CMS, which could actually be pretty fun to set up
- Last on the list are some quick updates to freshen up the [About](/about/) and [Garden](/notebook/) pages

Here's a wild thought that keeps coming back: what if I used [Jupyter][] Notebooks as the actual source files for posts? The possibilities are intriguing—data-driven posts with live visualizations, embedded 3D models you can interact with, computational stuff rendered right in the page. Might need to settle for linking out to external viewers or using embeds instead of native integration, but it still feels worth exploring.

Just thoughts percolating for now as the year winds down.
