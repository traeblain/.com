I spent forever just scrolling through this site.  It was amazing fun watching all the facts and details as you scoll up to the [Kármán Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line).  Sites like this don't get enough publicity but it really should.  Just a fun time.  Making sure my kids get to see it as well is a treat.  You should spend time there as well.  

Enjoy and let me know what you think as well.  Catch me at Mastodon.

So much fun.
