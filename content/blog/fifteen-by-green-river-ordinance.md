The [new album][amz] from Ft. Worth's own [Green River Ordinance][GRO] (GRO) was released a few weeks ago.  I've been able to listen to the entire album a couple times and I'm impressed at how good a release this is.  I initially found GRO by a random "give-away" by NoiseTrade (<- Gone...).  My son and I constantly blurt out **"She beats right through to the heart of me, to the part of me, that I can't explain!"**  Their new album, [Fifteen][amz], dives much deeper into their country roots, which might alienate a few listeners, but the album is still very strong.

The album starts off with probably their weakest song of the album, _Keep Your Cool_ is choppy and light.  I'm surprised it was ordered so early, but once you get past this one you are good.  _Red Fire Night_ is a great song.  It's currently charting high on the Folk charts (GRO has been [snubbed from the Country charts][billboard] regardless of the fact that many artists that make Billboard's country charts aren't country at all...), and for good reason. It is a classic feel-good, Texas bonfire song.

_Maybe It's Time (Gravity)_ reminds me of some classic 60s-70s tunes, although grounded in modern pop.  The next two songs are actually quite similar.  While _Simple Life_ is a classic ballad, _Tallahassee_ is classic country.  The next song is, honestly, probably the the best ballad I've heard in years.  _You, Me & the Sea_ curls beautiful prose into a melody that sticks with you...love this song.

The pop tune _Always Love Her_ transitions well into _Endlessly_. A song that already has a strong following from GRO's previous released EP.  An overtly Christian and testimonial song, _Only God Knows_, is punchy and strong, that it's place so late in the album is a bit of a surprise.  Rounding out the album is the blues-esque _Life in the Wind_ and another solid ballad _Keep My Heart Open_.
