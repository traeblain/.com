  Cleaned up the look and feel of the website again.  Less dealing with large views, and more addressing good design.  Clean and simple look.

It's the COVID isolation theme...  A bit more svelte and easier to handle, but still in the vein of what I've established as my style.  Right about now, is when I start talking about how I wish I would write more and that I will probably do it from now on...then the site sits still for months and months.  So I won't be saying that.

I would like to write more, but time is not on my side.  So that's why things stay stale.  I have some ideas, but seems like I always do.  Trying to work through the logistics of my plans and then go from there.  But drink in the new look and love all the new fun stuff on the [homepage](/).
