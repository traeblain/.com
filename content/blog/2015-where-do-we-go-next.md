So if you look at [my old site][blog] you'll see I made one post in 2015.  One solitary post in January of that year, then nothing.  There was a reason for that.  If you [read that post][2015], you'll see it was about simplifying my life.  One of those things I did, was remove myself from blogging for a time.  I don't know if it helped or hurt, but it was one of the things I did.

### So what about this year?

So for 2016, do I continue in the simplicity?  Maybe, maybe not.  I don't think I will.  I do have things to say from time to time, commentary on stuff that I wouldn't mind writing down and keeping.  So that's what this is.

The new site calls the blog something different.  Even though the link still says "blog", I will be referring to it as my "Notebook".  You'll see this in the menu and [homepage][], where it will still function like a blog and have comments available, it will really be my notebook.  I'll say a few things, write some thoughts down.  Maybe ask readers a few things, but really it will be a public collection of what's in my head.

Long form writing hasn't seen much traction lately in everyone's Facebook and Twitter-ized brain, but sometimes it's worth the time to take in more depth.  And where I cannot guarantee that this place will be full of things worth that time, I bet I'll have a few things to keep your interest.

Thanks for joining me.  Hope you'll stay awhile...
