So, I've been able to work on my own recently.  Due to people being out for Christmas and then many taking longer breaks than normal, I get to work on my own a bit.  That's good and bad for me because I do need some external stimuli to keep me moving...yet I've also been able to hyperfocus on a couple things well.

To maintain that focus I tend to listen to a great deal of music.  I have Spotify open and on repeat.  So, I figure I'd share the songs I cannot get enough of right now.  Enjoy.
